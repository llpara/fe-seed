Use `npm install` to download all project dependencies.

Use `node app.js` to start the server.

The available methods on the backend are:
```
    GET   /api/text      // retrieve a text fragment so you don't have to search the web
    POST  /api/save      // persist the body of the request to the server
    GET   /api/load      // retrieve what `/api/save` persisted

```

Good luck!
